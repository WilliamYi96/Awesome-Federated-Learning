# Awesome-Federated-Learning
A curated list of resources on federated learning, especially focusing on the theoretical perspectives. 

**Note:**          
- This repo maimly focusing on the theoretical perspectives of distributed machine learning and federated learning. Only very representive practical papers will be included.
- This repo is mainly sorted by topics instead of the publishing year, even though I would also sort papers in each topic by temporal sequence. 
- This repo will not only include published papers but will also cover selected unpublished arXiv papers.
- This repo do NOT cover every good paper in federated learning and will emphasize more on those interesting papers that I've read. I will also add necessary comment to some papers. Therefore, this list may contain understanding bias and personal preference.
- This repo is continually updating. 

## Local Training (LT) Methods
TBD.
